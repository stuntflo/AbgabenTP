                   <h1>MAIN CHARACTERS</h1>
                <p class="text1" >Coll (Colette): Coll is a teenager and about 17 years. She (almost) always takes the right decisions and she knows what she has to do. Coll isn't that tall and she wears normal clothes. A bad thing about Coll is that she’s uncertain.</p>
                <p class="text1" >Art: Art is also a teenager and about 18 years. He’s a self-confident guy and a bit pushy.
                The good things about him came later he’s nicer and more honest then first and he’s good-looking. </p>
                <p class="text1" >These two people have a lot of problems in this story; the real main character is Coll. In the story you are Coll, but Art plays also a big role in this story because they love each other. And the problems are between them.</p>

                   <h1>PLOT</h1> 
                    <p class="text1" >The relation of Coll and Art is over. But Coll loves him and wants him back (and Art wants her back). So they got for the a relation for the second time. Than she hears that her best friend Val is pregnant and she wants to help her and she wants to be there for her, but Art reacts careless and they don’t want to see each other for a time.</p>
                    <p class="text1" >Then Coll hears that Art was affair for several times and Coll wants to know what Art feels for her. Art tells she’s special for him but he isn’t that far to bind with someone. Coll is afraid and also Art gets a hard time, after that hard time Art makes the decision to move to New Zealand. Coll’s glad with this decision, but her question is: Shall she see ever see him?</p>

                  <h1>SETTING OF TIME AND PLACE</h1> 
                <p class="text" >The story is set in America. Most of the story goes on at the homes of Art or at the home of Coll. Sometimes they also meet in Pubs. Later Art is going to live in London because he goes to the college there. There is no nearer indication on the time but in my opinion the is quite modern.</p>
                <h1>LINGUISTIC ASPECTS</h1> 
                <p class="text" >The book “In the Deep End” is written in the past simple. The language of the book is quite difficult but if you read carefully and with attention you can follow the story.</p>

                 <h1>MAIN TOPIC</h1> 
                <p class="text" >In my opinion the main topic of the book is love and sex as the book is a romance. Most of the time the book talks about every kind of feelings such as love, happiness, jealousy, sadness or anger. It basically talks about every kind of feelings you might have during a relationship. Other than that, it shows the good things but also the problems and difficulties which you can face in a relationship very realistically. The other big topic is sex. How is the first time for Coll. Which new feelings Coll is getting to know while sex and so on.</p>

                  <h1>REVIEWS</h1>    
                <p class="text" >Basically the I found the book interesting to read beacause it is very realistic how the relationship of Art and Coll has ups and downs. But I also need to say that it is not really a book for men or boys because the main topic of the book is love and sex and most of the men don´t really like to read these type of books and they prefer action books. For girls this book might be very interesting and I also read some reviews of girls and they mostly liked it.</p>
